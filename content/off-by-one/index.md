This is a happy accident in the development of [GoLTWeb](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/GoLTGen), a cellular automaton with often overwhelming visualizations and patterns. In a cellular automaton a start condition must be given, here it was four squares, which should have resulted in a symmetric pattern, but it did not? Turns out the math for calculating the rectangles size was off, off by one to the left, resulting in this pattern growing in an unusual, yet interesting pattern.
