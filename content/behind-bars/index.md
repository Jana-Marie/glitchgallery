I was experimenting with digital TV reception with a cheap DVB-T stick if I remember correctly, and EyeTV. At some point I managed to detune and wiggle the antenna just right to get some great glitches. This one stuck out to me especially because the image quality itself is very soft but the glitch artifacts are sharp. Paired with the warm colors this looked so intentional to me that I had to save the capture.
