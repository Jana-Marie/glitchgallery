[Lambda Screen](https://text.marvinborner.de/2024-03-25-02.html) is a project
of mine which enables you to draw things (especially fractals) using pure
lambda calculus. While working on a variant that also supports *colors*, I got
some fun artifacts. It's mostly about me messing up the addition of strides
due to off-by-one errors.
