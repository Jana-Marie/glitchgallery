I was working on a video which was shot by me on Premiere Pro. After
working for 10 minutes, the software stopped working. I saw a black screen
and then again the Premiere Pro window editor popped up: My
original video had lost its colour and the elements in the video were all
outlined, with lower parts of the video missing.

I was colour-correcting the video, but after the software glitch, there were no
colours. But I liked the effect â€“ I hope to encouter this glitch again.
