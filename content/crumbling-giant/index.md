While animating a transition in some animation software (After Effects or Apple Motion) I accidentally deleted my asset which was a transparent pixel graphic of a red letter "x". All instances of my "x" got immediately replaced by black squares. Unfortunately I forgot why my background was a tilted checkerboard pattern in this screenshot. In any event, the mistake resulted in something I found deeply pleasing on a visual level, which is why I snapped a screenshot of the scene before undoing my mistake and continuing the actual animation.
