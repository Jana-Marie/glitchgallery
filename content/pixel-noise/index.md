I bought a used laptop with Windows XP to remember the old days and
take a fresh look at old systems from my experience (I am in software
quality assurance). At some point, I changed the screen settings and it began to
display in 8-bit. As an experiment, I set Euphoria screensaver and got
an error that this animation is not supported. I tried to run it again
anyway and got this screen.
