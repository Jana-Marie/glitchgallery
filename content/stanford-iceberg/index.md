This happened when we were working on an assignment in a real-time computer graphics course. We were supposed to draw the [Stanford Bunny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_bunny) using OpenGL's Vertex Buffer Objects, but it seems we got the indices wrong! You can kind of see the shape of the bunny's ears and nose, though!
