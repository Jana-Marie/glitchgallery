While attempting to plot some lines representing the routes of buses in
Edinburgh using some point-based [data](https://tfe-opendata.readme.io/docs/services),
I didn't account for multiple bus routes having the same destination. This
earned me some unexpected straight lines in addition to the squiggly lines I
was aiming for. The glowing neon style is courtesy of QGIS with some minor
tweaks.
