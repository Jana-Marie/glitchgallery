My currently installed version of Zoom Meetings interacts oddly with my newly purchased earbuds, wherein a large number (probably 10-15) of duplicate i/o devices representing the same pair of earbuds are listed in the Zoom audio settings. Zoom *also* spawns a new window to notify you when your audio device has changed. Lastly, my audio subsystem is set up to switch-on-connect to newly connected Bluetooth devices.

The result is a ton of new windows spawned - today I was closing these windows, and for some reason as I closed windows in my tiling window manager, they all coalesced into this blob of malformed window borders (yellow is the focused window, grey is unfocused.)

Quite the maelstrom of technical quirks - each piece a slightly imperfect tool, interacting unexpectedly with other imperfect tools.
