I used an online tool to convert a series of Street View screenshots
from the TIFF image format to JPEG and ended up with these altered previews.

I see an interesting symbolism here: Street View is a digitalization
of the real world. I wanted to print the Street View images â€“ to materialize
the digital, so to speak. But the glitch created a representation of "another
dimension" and showed the impossibility of coming back to reality.
