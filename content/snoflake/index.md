These non-snowflakes were created by the futile attempt of the artist to hastily solve their own programming exercise: Paint a snowflake with a for-loop in python with the turtle module. Obviously, the artist still had enough time to document their undertaking. 
This series is dedicated to the programming course 'clownfish'.
