This photo with a view out of my window on the 5th level was taken in June
2009 with a Canon EOS 350D. GIMP complains for corrupted data, but opens and
saves it anyways. Funny thing is: The thumbnail inside the JPG file shows the
correct image! All photos before and afterwards were ok. Until the camera
broke in 2018 after only ~30,000 photos it never happened again.
