This happened while working on my [image resampling library in C](https://github.com/Pi7on/Simple-PPM).

I think I was trying to resize the image of a blue and magenta test grid (visible on the left) using the nearest neighbour algorithm.

Sadly, I lost the original lossless image, and only this compressed version is left, which I salvaged from an old whatsapp chat with a friend.
