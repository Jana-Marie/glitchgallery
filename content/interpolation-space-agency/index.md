Pursuing shenanigous desires, the author was in dire need of a 
modifiable version of the 'thumbprint' logo of the European Space 
Agency. Following the official design guidelines, the author called upon 
Inkscape for the mere task of creating 27 concentric circles.

After creating an inner and an outer circle, Inkscapes *Interpolate 
Between Paths* extension applied not just the rest of the content but 
also itself for the position of the actual creator of this work.

The exact parameters of the process may have been lost to time, evidence 
of the authors inability to count to 27, however, has not.
