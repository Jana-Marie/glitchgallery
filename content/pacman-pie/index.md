While working on a project, one day I was trying to generate a pie chart using Python.

Didn't remember what exactly went wrong in the code but the system kind of
crashed and didn't respond for a while. When I opened the Jupyter notebook
again this is what I found in the output code cell. It generated thousands of
small pie charts (what you might see as Pacman-like structures) in a big pie.
Hence, the name “Pacman Pie”.
