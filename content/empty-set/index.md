An unexpected error was encountered during an experiment with OpenCV and Python while looking for new
ways to create algorithmic artwork.  A collection of randomly selected historical artworks was provided
as input, and the objective was to merge these images and apply a visual effect to make the output look
more like an oil painting. While the function for creating the oil painting effect was running, some type
of memory error was encountered, therefore causing only a small part of the input image set to be
processed, leaving a fraction of what would have been the final product.  The green and black colors
present a palette like a shard from a broken motherboard, which seems appropriate given the context for
this failed trial run.
