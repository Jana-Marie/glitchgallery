Through a yet unknown mechanism during loading data iOS's photos app decided to replace all photo thumbnails in year view with either light grey or black squares. The distribution paired with the number of pictures in each year of my photo library from 2007 to 2014 made it appear like a digital void infecting the past and slowly devouring the future, ever growing in the process.
