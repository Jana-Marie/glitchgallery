My partner, Brian, noticed that his phone had been taking pictures while he
had it in his pocket. He showed me a few of them and then started *deleting*
them, which is why I'm taking partial credit as the creator here.

*"What are you doing?! Those are amazing!!"*

I asked him for the phone and started scrolling through the images. Most of
them were gradations of color in the beige/green/gray range, many of a
single color, a few of 2-3 colors. This one stood out as it ran the gamut.
About half of them have the "ripped" looking edges in them, and maybe 4-5
of them have the black glitches along the edges.
