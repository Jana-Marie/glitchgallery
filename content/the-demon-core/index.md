I took this photo with a Sigma DP2 Merrill camera, which crashed as the photo was taken and I had to restart it.

Since then, the photo has crashed both the camera, as well as Sigma Photo Pro and my MacBook Pro every single time I tried to open it. Eventually, something got patched somewhere and the photo no longer crashes my laptop.

I am unsure how the pink noise banding at the top happened – all I can think was that it was a random camera glitch or a particle strike that caused the error whilst the file was being written to the card. All photos taken afterwards were fine, and the card that the 'demon core' was on was also fine. The camera still works fine and I’ve been unable to reproduce the problem since.
