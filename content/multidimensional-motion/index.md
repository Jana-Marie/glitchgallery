In the work, one still can see the motion which created the data – data that should have been depicted by python's matplotlib library. Actually the graph should have shown how the three room coordinates of multiple sensors in a motion tracking system changed over time – so the x axis should have been time (giving it the format: time, data1, data2 data3, ...). But matplotlib only used time for the first series and then paired the coordinates to themselves (assuming the format x, y, x, y, x, ... – as if it was time, data1, time, data2, time, data3, ...).
