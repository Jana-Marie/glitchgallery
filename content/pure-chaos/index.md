An accidental collage of an unknown number of images shot at 37c3 in Hamburg with an analog camera. The Olympus 35 RD I used jammed and didn't advance it's film. This is of all 36 possible shots of a standard roll of film the sole one that was left on the camera. In it I have regocnized about 13 different shots by the time of writing. While I'm sad that I just got one image out of all the images I tried to create, the result is yet stunning and maybe captures the chaos present at said event in the only way possible. In essence, pure chaos.

- **Camera:** Olympus 35 RD
- **Lens:** F. Zuiko 40mm f1.7
