I was trying to plot the sequences as visualized in a circle using Python's
"turtle" module. The circle was divided into *n* points. The numbers in the sequences
were modded with another number, and the result was used to mark the next
point in the circle while connecting it with the last point.

This created beautiful patterns, expressing the fundamental nature of symmetry
with modular arithmetic in common math sequences.
