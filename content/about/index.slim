    h2 About

    p Imagine yourself implementing a raytracer, generating a scatter plot, or developing a geometric algorithm, and BAM!!! It all blows up in your face! All you get is a colorful flurry, or a mess of abstract shapes. You could react to this by throwing your hands in the air, cursing the gods of linear algebra, and frustratedly starting to look for the bug.

    p Alternatively, take a screenshot, and celebrate that unexpected beauty! These moments are often a really interesting case of "unintentional art" â€“ a collaboration between a human, a computational system, and raw entropy!

    markdown: The Glitch Gallery is a place for that art! It's an enthusiastic embrace of mistakes, and a celebration of emergent beauty. It was established in the beginning of 2020 by [blinry](//blinry.org), also known as [blinry](//twitter.com/blinry). We took inspiration from the [accidental aRt](//accidental-art.tumblr.com) Tumblr, which you should check out if you're into data visualization!
